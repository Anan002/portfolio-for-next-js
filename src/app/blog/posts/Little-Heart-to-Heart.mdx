## Hello Makkalae!!

Let’s have a quick heart-to-heart today about something that lives quietly inside all of us but rarely gets spoken out loud — **expectations**.

We’ve all been there, right? As humans, we carry expectations everywhere — from people, from life, from the world. Sometimes we don’t even realize how much we expect until something doesn’t go our way.

Even while writing this blog, I had a little expectation too — that maybe, just maybe, whoever reads this will walk away with a new perspective. That it's okay to "let go of expectations".

### So... where do these expectations even come from?

Let’s be real. Most expectations are born from a simple desire — to be happy.  
“If that person does this for me, I’ll feel awesome.”  
“If I get that one thing, life will be perfect.”  
Sound familiar?

We create little movies in our minds where everything goes just the way we imagine. But what if it doesn’t? That’s when it hurts. That’s when the mind gets disturbed, confused.  
And why?  
Because we’re humans. We’re emotional. We dream.

Now there are two kinds of expectations we usually deal with:

1. From others – You expect someone to understand you, care for you, show up for you… and when they don’t, it hurts.
2. From life – You work hard, hoping that in a few years you’ll have your dream home, your happy family, your peaceful life. And sometimes… life takes a different route.

**There’s a line I love:**

**“Don’t get too used to the happiness others give you, unless they’re permanent.”**

But here’s the twist — even the so-called permanent things don’t always stay the same. People change. Situations shift. And when expectations grow too high, the fall can feel even harder.

### So, what’s the solution?

Here’s the truth: The solution is **YOU**.

The only way to truly break free from the pain of expectations is through **acceptance**.

Accept that life is unpredictable.  
Accept that not everything will go your way.  
Accept people as they are.  
Accept the now.

When you start accepting instead of expecting, you’ll notice life becomes a little lighter. A little kinder. A little more peaceful.

So makkalae, don’t waste your precious energy on expecting how things “should” be. Instead, be ready to **embrace life as it is**.

Trust the timing. Trust the process. And most importantly, **trust yourself**.

With love,  
**Anandan**
