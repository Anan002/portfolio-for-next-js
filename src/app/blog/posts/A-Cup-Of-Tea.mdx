Hello Makkale!!

In this blog, I just want to share something simple but special – A Cup of Tea. The moment we hear this name, it brings a smile and makes our mind fresh, right? Tea has a small but strong role in our lives.

Let’s rewind to school days. Not even college, let's go back to 10th standard. Whenever we go to our hometown, after getting down from the bus, what do we search first? “Where is the tea shop da?” That feeling! Tea was the last thing we searched for, but it gave the first happiness.

Then college life – the golden days. After college hours or after an industrial visit, we all gather at the tea shop. That small glass of tea becomes a reason to talk about everything – the whole day’s stories, scolding professors, sharing gossips, teasing a friend for seeing a girl, or making fun – in all those, tea was like one of our gang members.

After college, we enter work life – full of tension, targets, and meetings. But still, we wait for one thing – tea time. That small break with colleagues, holding a cup of tea, laughing, gossiping – gives so much relief. That few minutes feel like heaven in between all the rush.

But tea is not just for fun and friends. Sometimes, it also helps to start a new story. Think about it – when we like someone, what do we say? “Shall we go for tea or coffee?” From there, a new story begins. At that moment, a cup of tea becomes a special thing.

When we look back, we can see – tea was always there with us in every stage. It’s not just a drink. It’s an emotion. It’s like a small power booster, a mood changer, a memory creator.

And the best thing – you don’t need someone else to enjoy tea. Try sitting alone in a tea shop at night, wearing earphones, listening to an Ilaiyaraja song, looking at the sky and the roads, and feeling the wind. Then take that first sip of tea – my god, that feeling! Pure peace. Just talking about it gives me that vibe – are you feeling it too?

If you’ve never tried having tea alone like that, don’t miss it. Try once and tell me how it felt.
