When I was born as a human, I didn’t know my destiny. Throughout my childhood and even until I completed my graduation, I had no idea what the actual world was like or how people truly were.

Being a middle-class boy meant constantly dreaming of a high-five life or living with different expectations influenced by others. That’s the bitter truth, right? When I was in 3rd grade, I dreamed of buying a bicycle. That remained my dream until 8th grade. In 10th grade, my dream changed—I wanted to be the state’s top student. After completing 10th, I chose Bio-Maths in 11th grade, aspiring to become a doctor. Then in college, my dream shifted again—to at least secure a good job and make my family happy.

Even after immense effort, things didn’t come easily. However, my journey to Dubai became the turning point of my life. I saw people from different countries, spent 60 days there, and encountered new faces every day. Watching them, I realized what life truly was. Life is not just about having a job and settling down—there’s so much beyond that. Witnessing people’s happiness, their smiles, and the incredible human-made infrastructures, I also saw how nature embraced us.

Later, I moved to Hyderabad, the first time I was away from my family. I lived alone for over a year, handling everything on my own. It was like a crash course in life itself. Every morning, while making my bed and getting ready for work, a thought would cross my mind—why are we running every day? Is it for family? For ourselves? Or just to show society that we are living well? These questions haunted me daily. Amidst all this, I experienced small moments of love in my heart through the people around me.

One night, exactly in front of a hospital, I sat under a tree, watching people walk in with hope in their eyes. Vehicles moved here and there on the roads, and I looked up at the stars in the sky, feeling the breezy air. In that moment, memories of my travels, the people I had met, and the love I had felt for nature and everything around me played in my mind. That was when I felt fear—fear of death, fear of leaving this world. I didn’t want to die. I didn’t want to leave this beautiful world. That was the moment I realized how deeply I loved this world.

I am still running, chasing different dreams. But now, I run with love for this world. As I step into marriage and embrace fatherhood, my love for my family grows even stronger. And when my time comes, in that final second, I know I will feel it deeply—I will miss this world.
