## Overview

This project involved the development of several key features for Dainik Bhaskar's Inside Sales App, including a client upload service, client allocation based on specific conditions, maintaining client response tracking, WhatsApp scheduling, and report generation. I was responsible for handling all aspects of the database, UI, backend development, client interaction, and the complete Business Requirement Document (BRD) development from start to finish.

## Key Features

- **Client Upload Service**: Developed a service that enables the efficient upload of client data into the system, ensuring accurate and timely integration of new client information.
- **Client Allocation**: Implemented an intelligent system that automatically allocates clients to sales teams based on predefined conditions and criteria, streamlining team management.
- **Client Response Tracking**: Built a feature to track and maintain client responses, improving follow-ups and ensuring no leads are lost.
- **WhatsApp Scheduling**: Integrated Route Mobileâ€™s API to schedule and automate WhatsApp messages for sales updates and client communication, enhancing client interaction efficiency.
- **Reporting and Performance Tracking**: Developed a robust reporting system that generates sales reports and tracks individual and team performance, aiding in performance analysis and decision-making.
- **UI and Backend Development**: Designed and developed both the UI and backend systems, ensuring seamless integration of all features and a smooth user experience.
- **Database Structuring**: Overhauled the database structure to accommodate new features, ensuring data consistency, scalability, and smooth data flow.
- **FSE App Integration**: Integrated the Field Sales Executive (FSE) app with the Inside Sales web app for real-time data updates, ensuring synchronization between platforms and seamless information flow.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: ASPX WebForms for the user interface.
- **Backend**: API and Windows Services for robust functionality and integration.
- **Database**:  Oracle SQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Third party features**: Route Mobile integration for WhatsApp messaging.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge in this project was integrating new requirements into an existing application that had already been developed. This required extensive changes to the database structure and seamless incorporation of new features without disrupting the existing functionality. Additionally, integrating the FSE app with the Inside Sales app for real-time data updates posed its own set of challenges, requiring precise synchronization between both systems.

## Outcome

By implementing these new features, the Inside Sales App now enables users to maintain client interaction data in a more efficient and organized manner. Sales teams can easily track responses, generate reports, and communicate with clients via WhatsApp. These enhancements have significantly improved the sales team's productivity and overall client management.
