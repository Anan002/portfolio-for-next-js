## Overview

The Reval ERP Product is designed to efficiently manage multiple sites with a centralized approach. There are two types of sites: Main Site and Respective Sites.The Main Site acts as a central hub to manage all the Respective Sites.
I developed the Site Maintenance Module of U Layout, including APIs for retrieving general site information, maintaining site subscriptions, and managing site module permissions.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Site Management**:Developed and implemented a Dynamic Module Editing system, enabling administrators to customize and configure modules for each site as needed.
- **Permission Control**: Designed a layout of flexible Module Permission Management system to handle user access and module visibility across various sites.
- **Site Subscription Maintenance**: Built an API system to manage site subscriptions, keeping track of active and inactive sites for better operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular for the user interface.
- **Backend**: API.
- **Database**: Ms Sql.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was designing a Dynamic Module Editing and Permission System that could be customized for different sites without compromising on usability. Through effective planning and development, I successfully implemented a solution that enhanced the flexibility and control of site management.

## Outcome

By incorporating dynamic site management and permission control, the Admin can now effortlessly manage Respective Sites from the Main Site. This solution significantly improves operational efficiency and enhances user experience.
